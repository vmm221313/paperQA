<s> pulmonary fibrosis is caused by a combination of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) and inhaled toxicants.<n> the disease is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the lower lung parenchyma, including interstitial fibrosis and alveolar type ii fibrosis.<n> copd and inhaled toxicants are known to cause pulmonary fibrosis in humans, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.<n> this study examined the contribution of copd and inhaled toxicants to the development of pulmonary fibrosis in mice.<n> the animals were divided into three groups : non - smokers, smokers with pulmonary fibrosis and non - smokers with pulmonary fibrosis.<n> the animals of the first group were treated with an intratracheal instillation of n - acetyl - l - cysteine ( nac ), whereas those of the second group were treated with a combination of n - acetyl - l - cysteine ( nac ) and the antifibrotic agent acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ).<n> after a 4-week course of nac treatment, the animals of the second group developed a more complete clinical and histological response to nac compared with that of the third group.<n> pulmonary fibrosis was characterized
