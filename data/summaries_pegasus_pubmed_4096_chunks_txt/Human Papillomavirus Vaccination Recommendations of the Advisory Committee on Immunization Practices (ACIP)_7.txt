<s> the papillomavirus ( pv ) is the most common cause of cervical cancer in women.<n> pv is a member of the transient receptor potential ( trp ) serine / threonine kinase superfamily, and is the only member of the trp serine / threonine kinase superfamily identified with human papillomavirus ( hpv ).<n> hpv is the only member of the hpv serine / threonine kinase superfamily to be recognized and purified by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ), making it a potential target for the development of new anti - cancer drugs.<n> the anti - cancer properties of hpv have been demonstrated through the use of several in vitro and in vivo models.<n> however, the use of recombinant hpv serine / threonine kinases ( rsks ) and recombinant hpv serine / threonine kinase inhibitors ( rskis ) in clinical trials for the treatment of cervical cancer is still controversial. in this issue of the journal,<n> two authors discuss the use of recombinant hpv serine / threonine kinase inhibitors ( rhki
