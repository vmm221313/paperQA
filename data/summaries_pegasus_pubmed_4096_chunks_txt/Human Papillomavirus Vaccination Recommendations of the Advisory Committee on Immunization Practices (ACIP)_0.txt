<s> the papillomavirus ( pv ) is a member of the herpesvirus family of viruses.<n> although pv is the only member of this family to be found in humans, most cases of human papillomavirus ( hpv ) infection are due to the inactivated form of the virus.<n> hpv inactivation has been linked to cervical cancer, the most common type of genital cancer in women.<n> the disease is caused by the inactivated form of the virus, which infects a cell through the papillomavirus - dependent endocytic pathway. in this review,<n> we focus on hpv inactivation as a possible cause of genital cancer in women. to date<n>, the only other documented human hpv infection in a woman is that of cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) inactivation in cervical cancer patients during the early part of the twentieth century.<n> although hpv inactivation has been proposed as a cause of genital cancer in women, there is no evidence to support such a theory at the molecular level.<n> in addition, it is not known whether the inactivation of the inactivated form of the virus is a cause or consequence of the disease
