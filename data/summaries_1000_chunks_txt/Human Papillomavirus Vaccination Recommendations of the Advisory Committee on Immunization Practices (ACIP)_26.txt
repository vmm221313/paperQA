</s><s><s><s> recommendations for use of human papillomavirus ( hpv ) vaccine types 16 and 18 are the cause of approximately 70% of cervical cancers and most other HPV-attributable cancers ; the vaccines can protect against types not already acquired. 
 although vaccine effectiveness would be lower when administered to those who are sexually active, and would decrease with older age and likelihood of previous exposure, the majority of persons in the recommended age groups will derive at least partial benefit from vaccination, because fewer would have incident infection that could be prevented and the risk for development of disease from incident infection is less. although routine vaccination is recommended at age 11 or 12 years, older adolescents and young adults who are not yet sexually active can expect to receive the full benefit of vaccination. </s>
