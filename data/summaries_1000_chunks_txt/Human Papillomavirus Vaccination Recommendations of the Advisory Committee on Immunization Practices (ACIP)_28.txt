</s><s><s><s> since the introduction of human papillomavirus ( hpv ) vaccine in the united states in 2010, substantial additional data have been provided by clinical trials and postlicensure evaluations. 
 the vaccines have not been associated causally with adverse outcomes of pregnancy or adverse events in the developing fetus ; however, if a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the vaccination series, the remainder of the 3-dose series should be delayed until completion of the pregnancy. if a vaccine dose has been administered during pregnancy, no intervention is needed. to determine earlier impact of vaccination, several more proximal outcomes are being monitored, including HPV prevalence, genital warts, and cervical precancers. </s>
