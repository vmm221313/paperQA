</s><s><s><s> background and objectiveshuman papillomavirus ( hpv ) vaccines are highly effective and safe, and a powerful pre -vention tool for reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections and HPV-associated cancers. 
 based on the available immunogenicity evidence, a 2-dose schedule ( 0, 6 - 12 months ) will have efficacy equivalent to a 3-dose regimen ( 0, 1 - 2, 6 months ) if the vaccination series is initiated before the 15th birthday ( grade evidence type 3 ). the us department of health and human services/centers for Disease control and prevention recommends vaccination with 3 doses of vaccine for females and males aged 9 through 26 years with primary or secondary immuno - compromising conditions that might reduce cell - mediated or humoral immunity, such as lymphocyte lymphocyte deficiencies, complete or partial defects, or immunosuppression because immune response to vaccination might be attenuated.methods and resultssubjects were excluded when 2-dosing interval was not < 5 months.resultssince the vaccination schedule is inter - interrupted, the series does not need to be restarted.conclusionsbased on available evidence, the american commission on child protection and immunization recommendations for the vaccination of girls and boys who initiate a vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years ( category a recommendation ) recommends vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and at age 26 years for those who were not adequately vaccinated previously ( category b recommendation ). </s>
