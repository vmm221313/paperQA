</s><s><s><s> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( cpd ) is an important contributor to both mortality and disability in the united states. 
 persons with cpd are less likely to be employed and more likely to report being limited in the type of work they can do compared with persons without the condition. in this study, 
 adults with cdp were more likely than adults without cpd to report activity limitations and being unable to work compared with adults without the disease. because there is currently no cure for cpd, public health efforts should focus on prevention, such as antismoking. </s>
