</s><s><s><s> vaccination is recommended through the recommended age for females regardless of whether they have an abnormal pap test result, and for females or males regardless of known infection, HPV-associated precancer lesions, cancer, or anogenital warts. 
 however, if vaccination providers do not know or have available the vaccine product previously administered, either product may be used to continue or complete the series for females to provide protection against the vaccine types not already acquired. only the vaccine for males is licensed for use in males. </s>
