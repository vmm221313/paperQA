</s><s><s><s> the routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls with either bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine 2 or 4 is a cost-effective use of public health resources, as long as vaccine duration of protection is sufficient (e.g., 30 years ). 
 although cost-effectiveness estimates for vaccination of girls aged 12 years are quite consistent across published models, cost estimates of vaccination of females aged >12 years and for adult males are more uncertain and less precise. the cost of adding males to a female-only vaccination program depends on the vaccination coverage in females and cost of vaccine. as vaccination coverage of females increases, the health burden of genital warts can be reduced in both females and males ( through herd immunity ), thereby reducing the potential benefits of male vaccination. </s>
