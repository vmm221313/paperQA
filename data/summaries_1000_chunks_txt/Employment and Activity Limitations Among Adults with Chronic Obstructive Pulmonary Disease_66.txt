</s><s> mycoplasma pneumoniae is an atypical bacterial organism that can be treated with fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, or macro -lides. 
 it usually is not associated with fatalities, and outbreaks are not commonly reported among geriatric popula -tions. however, older persons are at increased risk for death, and diagnosis of m. pneumoniae infection can be delayed because older patients, who might have dementia and other comorbidi -ties, often do not have fever or classic pneumonia symptoms. during the summer of 2014, 41 probable and 14 laboratory -con -firmed cases of  
 m.  pneumoniae were associated with a single long - term care facility, and the facility was closed to new admissions for a prolonged period. </s>
