<pad> Vaccination produced antibody titers higher than those after natural infection: among females aged 16–23 years, anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 vaccine doses were higher than those observed in participants who were HPV seropositive and PCR negative at enrollment in the placebo group (123).Vaccination of females who were seropositive to a specific vaccine HPV type at enrollment resulted in higher antibody titers to that type, particularly after the first dose, compared with those seronegative at enrollment (131).Data on immunogenicity among males are available from the phase III trial in males aged 16–26 years and immunogenicity trials among males aged 9–15 years (133, 128,132). Among males in the efficacy trial, seroconversion rates were 97%, 89%, and 89% 1 month after the third dose (132, 128,132).Data on immunogenicity among males are available from the phase III trial in males aged 16–26 years and immunogenicity trials among males aged 9–15 years (133, 128,132). Vaccination produced antibody titers higher than those after natural infection: among females aged 16–23 years, anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 vaccine doses were higher than those observed in participants who were HPV seropositive and PCR negative at</s>
