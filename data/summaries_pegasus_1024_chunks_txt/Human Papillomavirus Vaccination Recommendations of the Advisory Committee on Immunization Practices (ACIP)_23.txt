<pad> The recommendation for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years is based on several considerations including studies indicating that HPV vaccines are safe and immunogenic in this age group, the higher antibody titers achieved after vaccination at age 11 or 12 years compared with older age groups, data on HPV DNA, and age of sexual debut in the United States (recommended 128,167,196). The recommendation also considered cost-effectiveness evaluations and the established young adolescent health-care visit at age 11 or 12 years recommended by several professional organizations, when receipt of other vaccines also is recommended (recommended 197).Data suggest that protection after vaccination will be long lasting (124â€“126,166); long-term follow-up studies are underway to determine the duration of protection.HPV vaccines are not licensed in the United States for use in persons aged >26 years.</s>
