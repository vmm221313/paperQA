<pad> A study among men aged 18â€“70 years seeking information about sexually transmitted disease testing from Brazil, Mexico, and the United States determined that genital HPV prevalence ranged from 52% to 69% by country, with no consistent variation by age (28).Studies of incident HPV infections demonstrate that first HPV infection occurs within a few years of becoming sexually active. The usual risk for HPV infection and progression to cervical cancer is relatively high among those with sex partners at least 30 years older than those with sex partners less than 30 years older (33).Most HPV infections are acquired through oral-genital routes but also will be an underestimate because not all persons with natural HPV infection develop or maintain detectable antibodies.</s>
