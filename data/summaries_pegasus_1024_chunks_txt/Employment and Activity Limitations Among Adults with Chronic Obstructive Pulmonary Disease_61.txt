<pad> In a comparison of 4vHPV with 9vHPV in approximately 600 adolescent females aged 9 through 15 years, 100% seroconverted to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 in both groups, and GMTs were noninferior in the 9vHPV group compared with the 4vHPV group.Immunogenicity in males aged 16 through 26 years was compared with females of the same age group in a separate study. In both females and males, >99% seroconverted to all nine HPV vaccine types, and GMTs in males were noninferior to those in females (4).The immunogenicity of concomitant and nonconcomitant administration of 9vHPV with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Menactra, MenACWY-D) and tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine (Adacel, Tdap) was evaluated.</s>
