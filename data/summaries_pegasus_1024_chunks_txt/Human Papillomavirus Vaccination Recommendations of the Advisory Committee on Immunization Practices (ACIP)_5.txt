<pad> On the basis of data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), the burden of HPV-associated cancers in the United States has been estimated (58).Because cancer registries typically do not capture information on HPV, the number of HPV-attributable cancers was estimated by multiplying the number of cancers at each body site (HPV-associated) by the percentage attributable to HPV, based on genotyping studies ( 59–64). Among these six cancers, approximately 17,500 were attributable to HPV16/18 (91% of HPV lesions were detected with AIS cytology, and 61% of HPV lesions were detected with LSIL cytology, respectively) (Table 2).Data from nine cancer registries in the SEER program have been analyzed to obtain long-term trends of invasive HPV-associated cancers and their prevalence among women from 1978 through 2007 ( 65), and data from 42 NPCR/SEER cancer registries that cover a larger percentage of the U.S.</s>
