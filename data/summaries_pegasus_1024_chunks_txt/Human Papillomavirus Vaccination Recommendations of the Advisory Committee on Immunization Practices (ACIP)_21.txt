<pad> The remainder ($6.6 billion) was for cervical cancer screening and follow-up.Modeling studies have shown consistently that the routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls with either HPV2 or HPV4 is a cost-effective use of public health resources, as long as vaccine duration of protection is sufficient (e.g., 30 years) (9.8179). Estimates of the incremental cost per quality-of-life year (QALY) gained by adding HPV vaccination of girls aged 12 years to existing cervical cancer screening programs vary (approximate range: $3,000â€“$45,000) (188.686).Although cost-effectiveness estimates for vaccination of girls aged 12 years are quite consistent across published models, cost-effectiveness estimates for vaccination of females aged >12 years and for vaccination of males are more uncertain and less precise.</s>
