        "Introduction": 
            "Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated
            diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee
            on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends
            HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be
            given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been
            recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and
            since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special
            populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP
            catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance
            published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed.
            In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination
            for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend
            catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years,
            but recognized that some persons who are not adequately
            vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might
            benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP
            recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding
            potential HPV vaccination for these persons.",
        "Background": 
            "HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection, with HPV
            acquisition generally occurring soon after first sexual activity
            (1). Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic.
            Persistent infections with high-risk (oncogenic) HPV types can
            lead to development of cervical, anal, penile, vaginal, vulvar, and
            oropharyngeal cancers, usually after several decades (1). Most 
            new HPV infections occur in adolescents and young adults.
            Although most sexually active adults have been exposed to
            HPV (4), new infections can occur with a new sex partner (5).
            Three prophylactic HPV vaccines are licensed for use in the
            United States: 9-valent (9vHPV, Gardasil 9, Merck), quadrivalent (4vHPV, Gardasil, Merck), and bivalent (2vHPV,
            Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline) (6–8). As of late 2016, only
            9vHPV is distributed in the United States. The majority of
            HPV-associated cancers are caused by HPV 16 or 18, types
            targeted by all three vaccines. In addition, 4vHPV and 9vHPV
            target HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts. 9vHPV
            also protects against five additional high-risk types: HPV 31,
            33, 45, 52, and 58.
            In October 2018, using results from 4vHPV clinical trials in
            women aged 24 through 45 years, and bridging immunogenicity and safety data in women and men, the Food and Drug
            Administration expanded the approved age range for 9vHPV
            use from 9 through 26 years to 9 through 45 years in women
            and men (6). In June 2019, after reviewing evidence related to
            HPV vaccination of adults, ACIP updated recommendations
            for catch-up vaccination and for vaccination of adults older
            than the recommended catch-up age",
        "Methods": 
            "During April 2018–June 2019, the ACIP HPV Vaccines
            Work Group held at least monthly conference calls to review
            and discuss relevant scientific evidence regarding adult
            HPV vaccination using the Evidence to Recommendations
            framework. (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/
            downloads/ACIP-evidence-rec-frame-508.pdf). The Work
            Group evaluated the quality of evidence for efficacy, safety, and
            effectiveness for HPV vaccination for primary prevention of
            HPV infection and HPV-related disease using the Grading of
            Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
            (GRADE) approach (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/
            grade/about-grade.html).
            Scientific literature published during January 1, 2006–
            October 18, 2018, was searched to identify clinical trials of
            any licensed HPV vaccine in adults aged 27 through 45 years.
            Detailed search methods and results for the GRADE tables
            are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/
            HPV-adults.html. Benefits were based on per-protocol analyses 
            of vaccine efficacy; immunogenicity data were also considered.
            Harms were any vaccine-related serious adverse events. Of
            1,388 references identified, 100 were selected for detailed
            review, and 16 publications were included in GRADE tables
            presented at the October 2018 ACIP meeting; tables were
            updated in June 2019 to include new results from a 9vHPV
            trial. At the June 2019 ACIP meeting, two policy issues were
            considered: 1) harmonization of catch-up vaccination for all
            persons through age 26 years, and 2) vaccination of adults aged
            >26 years. Two Evidence to Recommendations documents
            were developed (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/
            grade/HPV-harmonization-etr.html) (https://www.cdc.gov/
            vaccines/acip/recs/grade/HPV-adults-etr.html) and presented
            along with proposed recommendations; after a public comment period, ACIP members voted unanimously to harmonize
            catch-up vaccination recommendations across genders for
            all persons through age 26 years. ACIP members also voted
            10–4 in favor of shared clinical decision-making for adults
            aged 27 through 45 years, recognizing that some persons who
            are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV
            infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.",
        "section_4": 
            "Vaccine efficacy and safety. Data were considered from
            11 clinical trials of 9vHPV, 4vHPV, and/or 2vHPV in adults
            aged 27 through 45 years, along with supplemental bridging
            immunogenicity data. In per-protocol analyses from three
            trials, 4vHPV and 2vHPV demonstrated significant efficacy
            against a combined endpoint of persistent vaccine-type HPV
            infections, anogenital warts, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 (low-grade lesions) or worse. In nine
            trials, seroconversion rates to vaccine-type HPV after 3 doses
            of any HPV vaccine were 93.6%–100% at 7 months after
            the first dose. Overall evidence on benefits was GRADE
            evidence level 2, for moderate-quality evidence. In nine trials, few serious adverse events and no vaccine-related deaths
            were reported. Overall evidence on harms was also GRADE
            evidence level 2, for moderate-quality evidence. In the efficacy
            trial that was the basis for 9vHPV licensure for adults through
            age 45 years, per-protocol efficacy of 4vHPV among women
            aged 24 through 45 years was 88.7% (95% confidence interval
            [CI] = 78.1–94.8), and intention-to-treat efficacy was 47.2%
            (95% CI = 33.5–58.2) against a combined endpoint of persistent infections, extragenital lesions, and CIN 1+ related to
            HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 (9).
            HPV burden of disease and impact of the vaccination
            program in the United States. Approximately 33,700 cancers
            are caused by HPV in the United States each year, including 12,900 oropharyngeal cancers among men and women,
            10,800 cervical cancers among women, and 6,000 anal cancers", 
            among men and women; vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers
            are less common (10). HPV vaccination for adolescents has
            been routinely recommended for females since 2006 and for
            males since 2011 (1). The existing HPV vaccination program
            for adolescents has the potential to prevent the majority of
            these cancers. Mean age at acquisition of causal HPV infection for cancers is unknown, but is estimated to be decades
            before cancer is diagnosed. In 2017, coverage with ≥1 dose of
            HPV vaccine was 65.5% among adolescents aged 13 through
            17 years (11). Although coverage with the recommended
            number of doses remains below the Healthy People 2020
            target of 80% for adolescents (12), the U.S. HPV vaccination
            program has resulted in significant declines in prevalences of
            vaccine-type HPV infections, anogenital warts, and cervical
            precancers (13). For example, prevalences of 4vHPV vaccinetype infection during 2013–2016, compared with those of the
            prevaccine era, declined from 11.5% to 1.8% among females
            aged 14 through 19 years and from 18.5% to 5.3% among
            females aged 20 through 24 years (14). In addition, declines
            have been observed among unvaccinated persons, suggesting
            protective herd effects (15).
            Health economic analyses. Five health economic models
            of HPV vaccination in the United States were reviewed (16).
            The cost effectiveness ratio for the current HPV vaccination
            program ranged from cost-saving to approximately $35,000
            per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (16). In the
            context of the existing vaccination program, the incremental
            cost per QALY for expanding male vaccination through age
            26 years was $178,000 in a subset of analyses in one of the five
            models reviewed using more favorable model assumptions for
            adult vaccination (16). In the context of the existing program,
            expanding vaccination to adults through age 45 years would
            produce relatively small additional health benefits and less
            favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. The incremental cost per
            QALY for also vaccinating adults through age 30 or 45 years
            exceeded $300,000 in four of five models (16). Variation in
            results across models was likely due to uncertainties about
            HPV natural history, such as prevalence of immunity after
            clearance of natural infections, and level of herd protection
            from the existing program. Under the existing program, in
            a subset of analyses in one of the five models reviewed using
            more favorable model assumptions for adult vaccination, the
            number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one case of
            anogenital warts, CIN grade 2 or worse (high-grade lesions),
            or cancer would be 9, 22, and 202, respectively. For expanding
            recommendations for males through age 26 years to harmonize
            catch-up vaccination across genders, these NNV would be 40,
            450, and 3,260, respectively. For expanding recommendations
            to include adults through age 45 years, these NNV would be
            120, 800, and 6,500, respectively (16).
